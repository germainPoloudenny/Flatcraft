 * Game map with the possibility to access neighboring cells.

 * The idea is a hide the way the cells are stored. As such, the current cell is
 * given as parameter, and the height neighboring cells are denoted by
 * directions.
 * 
 * Note that in some cases, there is no neighbor, which result in the choice to
 * return an Optional object, not directly a Cell.
